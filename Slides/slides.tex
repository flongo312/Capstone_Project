\begin{frame}{Understanding Time Value of Money (TVM)}
  \begin{block}{Objective}
    To understand the concept that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity.
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Key Concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Present Value (PV):} The current value of a future sum of money.
      \item \textbf{Future Value (FV):} The value of a current sum of money at a future date, based on an assumed rate of growth.
      \item \textbf{Discount Rate:} The rate used to discount future cash flows to their present value.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Time Value of Money (TVM) - Formulas}
  \begin{block}{Future Value Formula}
    \begin{equation*}
      FV = PV \times [1 + (i / n)]^{n \times t}
    \end{equation*}
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \( FV \) = Future Value
      \item \( PV \) = Present Value
      \item \( i \) = Interest rate per period
      \item \( n \) = Number of compounding periods per year
      \item \( t \) = Number of years

  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Explanation}
    This formula calculates the amount of money that an investment will grow to over a period of time when interest is compounded periodically. 
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Time Value of Money (TVM) - Present Value Formula}
  \begin{block}{Present Value Formula}
    \begin{equation*}
      PV = \frac{FV}{[1 + (i / n)]^{n \times t}}
    \end{equation*}
    where:

  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Time Value of Money (TVM) - Continuous Compounding}
  \begin{block}{Continuous Compounding Formula}
    \begin{equation*}
      FV = PV \times e^{rt}
    \end{equation*}
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \( FV \) = Future Value
      \item \( PV \) = Present Value
      \item \( e \) = Euler's number (approximately 2.71828)
      \item \( r \) = Annual interest rate
      \item \( t \) = Time in years
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Explanation}

\end{frame}

\section{Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)}
\begin{frame}{Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) - Overview}
  \begin{block}{Overview}
    Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), introduced by Harry Markowitz, is a framework for constructing a portfolio of assets such that the expected return is maximized for a given level of risk. It emphasizes diversification to reduce risk.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) - Key Assumptions}
  \begin{block}{Key Assumptions}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Investors are rational and risk-averse.
      \item Markets are efficient, and all investors have access to the same information.
      \item Asset returns are normally distributed.
      \item There are no transaction costs or taxes.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 1: Define Assets and Expected Returns}
  \begin{block}{Expected Returns}
    Identify the assets you want to include in the portfolio and estimate their expected returns (\(E(R_i)\)). This involves analyzing historical data, considering economic conditions, and using financial models.
    \begin{equation*}
      E(R_i) = \text{Expected return of asset } i
    \end{equation*}
    Example: 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Asset A: \(E(R_A) = 10\%\)
      \item Asset B: \(E(R_B) = 15\%\)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 2: Determine Asset Weights}
  \begin{block}{Weights}
    Decide on the proportion (\(w_i\)) of the total investment to allocate to each asset. The sum of the weights should equal 1.
    \begin{equation*}
      w_i = \text{Weight of asset } i
    \end{equation*}
    Example:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Weight of Asset A: \(w_A = 60\%\)
      \item Weight of Asset B: \(w_B = 40\%\)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 3: Calculate Portfolio's Expected Return}
  \begin{block}{Expected Return of Portfolio}
    The expected return of the portfolio (\(E(R_p)\)) is the weighted sum of the expected returns of the individual assets.
    \begin{equation*}
      E(R_p) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i E(R_i)
    \end{equation*}
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \( E(R_p) \) = Expected return of the portfolio
      \item \( w_i \) = Weight of asset \( i \) in the portfolio
      \item \( E(R_i) \) = Expected return of asset \( i \)
    \end{itemize}
    Example Calculation:
    \begin{equation*}
      E(R_p) = (0.60 \times 0.10) + (0.40 \times 0.15) = 0.12 \text{ or 12\%}
    \end{equation*}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 4: Calculate Covariances Between Assets}
  \begin{block}{Covariance}
    Covariance measures how two assets move together. A positive covariance means that the assets tend to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance means they move in opposite directions.
    \begin{equation*}
      \sigma_{ij} = \text{Cov}(R_i, R_j) = \mathbb{E}[(R_i - \mathbb{E}[R_i])(R_j - \mathbb{E}[R_j])]
    \end{equation*}
    Example:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Covariance between Asset A and Asset B: \(\sigma_{AB} = 0.02\)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 5: Calculate Portfolio's Variance (Risk)}
  \begin{block}{Variance of Portfolio}
    The variance (\(\sigma_p^2\)) of the portfolio's return is determined by the variances of the individual assets and the covariances between them.
    \begin{equation*}
      \sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_i w_j \sigma_{ij}
    \end{equation*}
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \( \sigma_p^2 \) = Variance of the portfolio's return
      \item \( w_i \) = Weight of asset \( i \) in the portfolio
      \item \( \sigma_{ij} \) = Covariance between asset \( i \) and asset \( j \)
    \end{itemize}
    Example Calculation:
    \begin{equation*}
      \sigma_p^2 = (0.60)^2 \times 0.04 + (0.40)^2 \times 0.09 + 2 \times 0.60 \times 0.40 \times 0.02 = 0.0384
    \end{equation*}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 6: Calculate Correlation Between Assets}
  \begin{block}{Correlation}
    Correlation is a standardized measure of covariance that ranges from -1 to 1.
    \begin{equation*}
      \rho_{ij} = \frac{\sigma_{ij}}{\sigma_i \sigma_j}
    \end{equation*}
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \( \rho_{ij} \) = Correlation coefficient between asset \( i \) and asset \( j \)
      \item \( \sigma_{ij} \) = Covariance between asset \( i \) and asset \( j \)
      \item \( \sigma_i \) = Standard deviation of asset \( i \)
      \item \( \sigma_j \) = Standard deviation of asset \( j \)
    \end{itemize}
    Example:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Correlation between Asset A and Asset B: \(\rho_{AB} = \frac{0.02}{\sqrt{0.04} \cdot \sqrt{0.09}} = 0.333\)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 7: Optimize the Portfolio}
  \begin{block}{Optimization}
    Adjust the weights of the assets to maximize the portfolio's expected return for a given level of risk or to minimize risk for a given level of expected return. This is done by solving the optimization problem:
    \begin{equation*}
      \min \sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_i w_j \sigma_{ij}
    \end{equation*}
    subject to:
    \begin{equation*}
      \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad E(R_p) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i E(R_i)
    \end{equation*}
    Example:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Adjust weights \(w_i\) to find the optimal portfolio that minimizes risk for a given expected return.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 8: Construct the Efficient Frontier}
  \begin{block}{Efficient Frontier}
    The efficient frontier represents the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk. By solving the optimization problem repeatedly for different levels of expected return, you can plot the efficient frontier.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Plot the portfolios on a graph with risk (standard deviation) on the x-axis and expected return on the y-axis.
    \end{itemize}
    Example:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The curve shows the optimal portfolios, with points above the curve being unachievable and points below the curve being inefficient.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\section{CAPM: Capital Asset Pricing Model}
\begin{frame}{Transition from MPT to CAPM}
  \begin{block}{From MPT to CAPM}
    While Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) focuses on the construction of optimal portfolios based on diversification and risk-return trade-offs, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) builds on this by explaining the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for individual assets.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item MPT provides the foundation for understanding the benefits of diversification.
      \item CAPM extends this by quantifying the expected return of an asset given its systematic risk.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) - Key Assumptions}
  \begin{block}{Key Assumptions}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Investors hold diversified portfolios.
      \item Markets are efficient, and all investors have access to the same information.
      \item There are no taxes or transaction costs.
      \item The risk-free rate is constant.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 1: Identify Risk-Free Rate}
  \begin{block}{Risk-Free Rate (\(R_f\))}
    The risk-free rate is the return on an investment with zero risk, typically represented by government bonds.
    \begin{equation*}
      R_f = \text{Risk-free rate}
    \end{equation*}
    Example:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Assume the risk-free rate is 3\%.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 2: Determine Market Return}
  \begin{block}{Market Return (\(E(R_m)\))}
    The expected return of the market is the average return of the market portfolio, which includes all investable assets.
    \begin{equation*}
      E(R_m) = \text{Expected return of the market}
    \end{equation*}
    Example:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Assume the expected market return is 8\%.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 3: Calculate Asset Beta}
  \begin{block}{Beta (\(\beta\))}
    Beta is a measure of an asset's volatility relative to the overall market. It indicates the asset's systematic risk.
    \begin{equation*}
      \beta_i = \frac{\text{Cov}(R_i, R_m)}{\sigma_m^2}
    \end{equation*}
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \( \text{Cov}(R_i, R_m) \) = Covariance of asset \( i \) with the market
      \item \( \sigma_m^2 \) = Variance of the market returns
    \end{itemize}
    Example Calculation:
    \begin{equation*}
      \beta_i = \frac{0.015}{0.02} = 0.75
    \end{equation*}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 4: Calculate Expected Return Using CAPM Formula}
  \begin{block}{CAPM Formula}
    The CAPM formula calculates the expected return of an asset based on its systematic risk (beta).
    \begin{equation*}
      E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f)
    \end{equation*}
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \( E(R_i) \) = Expected return of asset \( i \)
      \item \( R_f \) = Risk-free rate
      \item \( \beta_i \) = Beta of asset \( i \)
      \item \( E(R_m) \) = Expected return of the market
    \end{itemize}
    Example Calculation:
    \begin{equation*}
      E(R_i) = 3\% + 0.75 (8\% - 3\%) = 6.75\%
    \end{equation*}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 5: Plot the Security Market Line (SML)}
  \begin{block}{Security Market Line (SML)}
    The Security Market Line (SML) is a graphical representation of the CAPM. It plots the expected return of an asset against its beta.
    \begin{equation*}
      E(R_i) = R_f + \beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f)
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The y-intercept represents the risk-free rate (\(R_f\)).
      \item The slope represents the market risk premium (\(E(R_m) - R_f\)).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Explanation}
    The SML illustrates the trade-off between risk and return for efficient portfolios. Assets plotted above the SML are considered undervalued, while those below the SML are considered overvalued.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Step 6: Interpret the Results}
  \begin{block}{Interpreting the CAPM}
    Use the CAPM results to make informed investment decisions.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Compare the expected return calculated by CAPM with the actual return of the asset.
      \item Determine if the asset is fairly valued, undervalued, or overvalued based on its position relative to the SML.
    \end{itemize}
    Example:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If the actual return of an asset is 8\% but the CAPM expected return is 6.75\%, the asset may be undervalued.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\section{Monte Carlo Simulation}
\begin{frame}{Transition from CAPM to Monte Carlo Simulation}
  \begin{block}{From CAPM to Monte Carlo Simulation}
    While the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) helps in understanding the relationship between systematic risk and expected return, Monte Carlo Simulation provides a robust method for modeling the probability of different outcomes by incorporating randomness and uncertainty.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item CAPM gives a deterministic expected return for a given risk level.
      \item Monte Carlo Simulation introduces stochastic processes to evaluate the range of possible outcomes, providing a more comprehensive risk assessment.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Monte Carlo Simulation - Formula}
  \begin{block}{Formula}
    \begin{equation*}
      \text{E}(X) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} f(X_i)
    \end{equation*}
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \( \text{E}(X) \) = Expected value of the outcome
      \item \( N \) = Number of simulations
      \item \( f(X_i) \) = Function of the simulated variable \( X_i \)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Explanation}
    Monte Carlo Simulation uses repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The function \( f(X_i) \) represents the process being simulated. \( \text{E}(X) \) is the average result of all simulations.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
