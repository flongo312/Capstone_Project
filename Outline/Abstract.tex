This paper aims to develop tailored investment strategies for different age groups of first-time homebuyers to accumulate funds for down payments. Rising housing costs present significant challenges, particularly for younger individuals. By applying modern financial theories and data-driven insights, this research identifies optimal investment strategies to help various age groups save effectively for a down payment, thereby accelerating their path to homeownership. The study uses a combination of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), and statistical analysis to analyze data from Yahoo Finance. The findings suggest that diversified portfolios and lifecycle investing are the most effective strategies across different age groups.
