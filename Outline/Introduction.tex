\section{Introduction and Motivation}

\subsection{Introduction}
The objective of this research is to develop tailored investment strategies for different age groups of first-time homebuyers to accumulate funds for down payments. Rising housing costs present significant challenges for many first-time homebuyers, particularly younger individuals. This research aims to identify optimal investment strategies to help people in various age groups save effectively for a down payment, thereby accelerating their path to homeownership.

\subsection{Motivation}
Rising housing costs have made it increasingly difficult for first-time homebuyers to save for a down payment. According to the National Association of Realtors (2023), the average age of first-time homebuyers is 35 years, with a median income of $95,900. The financial landscape for these individuals is challenging, with the average home costing $348,000 and an average down payment savings of $8,220. By applying modern financial theories and data-driven insights, this research seeks to provide effective investment strategies that cater to the unique needs of different age groups, helping them navigate these challenges and expedite their journey to owning a home.
