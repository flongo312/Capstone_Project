\section{Conclusions}

This research provides a comprehensive analysis of optimal investment strategies for first-time homebuyers aiming to accumulate down payments over 5, 7.5, and 10-year horizons. By leveraging Modern Portfolio Theory, the Capital Asset Pricing Model, and Monte Carlo simulations, the study offers actionable insights into constructing age-specific investment portfolios.

The analysis of the summary statistics revealed that the selected securities have varying levels of risk and return, which are crucial for portfolio optimization. The optimal weights calculated for different time horizons indicate that a well-diversified portfolio, adjusted for market conditions, can significantly enhance investment outcomes.

The hindsight data comparison demonstrates that the optimized portfolios consistently outperform the S&P 500 benchmark, with the 10-year horizon portfolio exhibiting the highest cumulative return. This underscores the importance of long-term investing and strategic asset allocation. The results also emphasize the need for considering risk-adjusted returns and diversification in portfolio construction.

The composite score rankings provided a systematic approach to identifying top-performing securities, integrating key financial metrics to ensure a balanced evaluation. This ranking methodology helps investors make informed decisions, aligning their portfolios with their financial goals and risk tolerance.

Monte Carlo simulations further validated the robustness of the optimized portfolios by forecasting their potential future performance under various economic scenarios. The simulations highlighted the resilience of the portfolios, demonstrating their capacity to withstand market volatility and economic shocks.

Overall, the findings suggest that tailored investment strategies significantly enhance the ability to save for a down payment, reducing the time required to reach homeownership goals. Future research could extend this analysis to consider other demographic factors such as income levels and regional housing market conditions. Additionally, the integration of alternative investment vehicles such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) and cryptocurrencies could provide further insights into optimizing investment strategies for down payments.
