\section{Conclusions}

This research offers a comprehensive analysis of optimal investment strategies for first-time homebuyers seeking to accumulate down payments over 5, 7.5, and 10-year horizons. By leveraging Modern Portfolio Theory, the Capital Asset Pricing Model, and Monte Carlo simulations, the study provides valuable insights into constructing age-specific investment portfolios.

The analysis of summary statistics highlights the varying levels of risk and return associated with the selected securities, which are crucial for effective portfolio optimization. The calculated optimal weights for different time horizons suggest that a well-diversified portfolio, tailored to market conditions, can significantly enhance investment outcomes. The comparison with hindsight data demonstrates that optimized portfolios consistently outperform the S\&P 500 benchmark. This underscores the benefits of long-term investing and strategic asset allocation, emphasizing the importance of considering risk-adjusted returns and diversification in portfolio construction.

The composite score rankings offer a systematic approach to identifying top-performing securities by integrating key financial metrics. This methodology assists investors in making informed decisions, aligning their portfolios with their financial goals and risk tolerance. Monte Carlo simulations further validate the robustness of the optimized portfolios by forecasting their potential future performance under various economic scenarios. These simulations demonstrate the resilience of the portfolios, showcasing their capacity to withstand market volatility and economic shocks. Overall, the findings suggest that tailored investment strategies significantly improve the ability to save for a down payment, thereby reducing the time required to reach homeownership goals. Future research could expand this analysis by considering other demographic factors such as income levels and regional housing market conditions. Additionally, incorporating alternative investment vehicles such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) and cryptocurrencies could provide further insights into optimizing investment strategies for down payments.
