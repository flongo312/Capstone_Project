This paper aims to develop tailored investment strategies for different age groups of first-time homebuyers to accumulate funds for down payments. Rising housing costs present significant challenges, particularly for younger individuals. By applying modern financial theories and data-driven insights, this research identifies optimal investment strategies to help various age groups save effectively for a down payment, thereby accelerating their path to homeownership.
