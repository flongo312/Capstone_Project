This research conducts a detailed analysis of optimal investment strategies tailored for first-time homebuyers seeking to accumulate down payments over 5, 7.5, and 10-year horizons. By integrating Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), and Monte Carlo simulations, the study provides practical insights into constructing investment portfolios that are age-specific and balance risk and return effectively.

The findings reveal that customized investment strategies substantially improve the ability to save for a down payment, potentially shortening the time needed to achieve homeownership. The importance of considering risk-adjusted returns and diversification in portfolio construction is underscored, demonstrating their critical roles in enhancing savings outcomes.

Future research could broaden this analysis by incorporating additional demographic factors such as income variations and regional housing market dynamics. Furthermore, exploring the inclusion of alternative investment vehicles, such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) and cryptocurrencies, could offer deeper insights into optimizing investment strategies for down payments.
