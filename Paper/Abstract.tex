This research provides a comprehensive analysis of optimal investment strategies for first-time homebuyers aiming to accumulate down payments over 5, 7.5, and 10-year horizons. By leveraging Modern Portfolio Theory, the Capital Asset Pricing Model, and Monte Carlo simulations, the study offers actionable insights into constructing age-specific investment portfolios.

The results indicate that tailored investment strategies significantly enhance the ability to save for a down payment, reducing the time required to reach homeownership goals. The findings also highlight the importance of considering risk-adjusted returns and diversification in portfolio construction.

Future research could extend this analysis to consider other demographic factors such as income levels and regional housing market conditions. Additionally, the integration of alternative investment vehicles such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) and cryptocurrencies could provide further insights into optimizing investment strategies for down payments.
