\section{Introduction}
The escalating housing costs in contemporary real estate markets have created significant barriers for first-time homebuyers. This demographic often faces the daunting task of accumulating substantial down payments amidst economic volatility and uncertain income trajectories. This research addresses this critical issue by developing and evaluating optimal investment strategies tailored to help diverse age groups achieve their homeownership goals within 5, 7.5, and 10-year horizons.

\subsection{Research Question \& Objective}
The central research question guiding this investigation is: What are the most effective investment strategies for different age groups to accumulate housing down payments over periods of 5, 7.5, and 10 years? The primary objective of this study is to identify, analyze, and optimize investment strategies that can effectively assist first-time homebuyers in saving for their down payments. By leveraging advanced financial theories and empirical methodologies, this research aims to provide actionable insights that balance risk and return, offering practical solutions for prospective homeowners \citep{markowitz1952portfolio, sharpe1966mutual, boyle1977options}.

\subsection{Motivation}
The motivation for this research stems from the pressing need to address the challenges posed by rising housing costs and economic instability. As homeownership becomes increasingly out of reach for many, particularly younger individuals, it is imperative to develop strategies that can mitigate these barriers. By providing evidence-based investment strategies, this study aims to empower individuals with the tools needed to navigate the complexities of financial planning for homeownership \citep{nar, fed2023, bls2023}.
