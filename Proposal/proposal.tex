\section*{Interest and Relevance}

The topic of optimal investment strategies for Generation Z to accumulate housing down payments interests me due to my passion for economics and finance, and the unique financial challenges my generation faces, including student debt, rising living costs, and high inflation. As a member of Generation Z, I aim to explore practical solutions to achieve financial stability and homeownership.

This research is also relevant to businesses. Financial institutions, real estate firms, and investment advisors can use insights into the saving and investment behaviors of Generation Z to develop tailored financial products and services. These insights can enhance marketing strategies and customer engagement, driving business growth and customer loyalty.

\section*{Research Proposal}

To determine how Generation Z can optimize investment strategies for housing down payments, I propose the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Analyze investment strategies using Edward Thorp's quantitative approaches
\item Implement simulation models to evaluate the impact of various demographic profiles on investment outcomes
\item Assess the risk-return characteristics of equities, fixed-income securities, and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) for down payment savings
\item Use Monte Carlo simulations to generate probability distributions of achieving target down payment amounts
\item Conduct sensitivity analyses to explore the effects of economic variables (e.g., inflation, interest rates) on investment strategies
\item Integrate behavioral economics theories to understand Generation Z's saving and investment behaviors
\item Apply modern portfolio theory (MPT) to optimize asset allocation for down payment savings
\item Utilize life-cycle investing principles to adjust risk exposure as individuals approach their home purchase date
\end{itemize}

This approach will provide a nuanced understanding of optimal investment strategies for Generation Z, offering actionable recommendations to help this demographic achieve their homeownership goals.
